This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# SP-News Project

## Background

This project has been created to demonstrate my skills using React to build an app as part of the block review for the front-end stage of the Northcoders' Developer Pathway. This front end allows users to interact with the server I created from my back-end block review.
