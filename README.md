This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# SP-News Project

## Background

The goal of this project has been to create a React app to allows users to interact with articles hosted on a simple news website. The user is able to read articles on a range of subjects as well as leave comments and vote on the articles they like. The user is also able to delete any of the comments they have created.

This project has been created to demonstrate my React app building skills. This app has been submitted as my final test for the front-end stage of Northcoders' Developer Pathway course. 

This React app allows users to interact with the server I created as my final test back-end stage of the course.
